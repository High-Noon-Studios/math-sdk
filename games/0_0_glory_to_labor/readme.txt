# Glory to Labor

Glory to Labor is a 5-reel, 3-row lines game with multiplier wilds and sticky free spins.

## Base Game

**Reels**: 5 reels, 3 rows
**Paylines**: Traditional lines-based wins

**Symbol Distribution**:

- **Wild symbols**: Appear on reels 2, 3, and 4 with multipliers of 1x, 2x, or 3x
- **Regular symbols**: Standard slot symbols across all reels

**Wild Multiplier Mechanics**:
- Wilds substitute for all symbols except scatters
- Wild multipliers: 1x, 2x, or 3x
